A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing tasks. It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
The convolutional layers are the key component of a CNN, where filters are applied to the input image to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes
